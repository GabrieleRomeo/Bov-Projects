## Project Assignment 1:  Music Catalog

Create a simple music catalog that displays albums. Each album should be stored as an IndexedDB record, with properties for the album name, artist, track list, etc. The first time a user visits the page, the data may be downloaded from a server (hint: Use an online API such as Free Music Archive and then stored in IndexedDB. Subsequent visits to the page should load the data from IndexedDB.
