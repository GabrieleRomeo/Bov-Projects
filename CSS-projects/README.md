Introduction to CSS projects

Projects are built following the *mobile-first* approach. Therefore, layouts are fluid and responsive to fit with a broad range of devices.

CSS classes instead follow the [BEM](http://getbem.com/introduction/)'s naming convention as much as possible.

A significant part of the markup is composed by HTML5 elements (e.g. article, header, section, etc.)
